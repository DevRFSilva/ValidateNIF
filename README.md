# Validate Portuguese NIF (tax number)

Tool that allows you to check if a Portuguese NIF is valid. Just enter the number and the page will automatically tell you if it is valid or not.

## ‚úè How did this project start?

I created an auto-invoicing tool which allowed our customers to have their invoices automatically introduced to the tax authority. <br />
However, when developing the tool, I realized that the NIF (name for Portuguese Tax Number) had to be valid. Which meant that there would have to be a way to verify if the NIFs entered from the final buyers were really valid or not, and if they weren't, it would be necessary to prevent the form from being sent.<br />
After researching several tools (mostly paid) I found that the validation of NIFs is according to an algorithm and this validation could be carried out within the site without having to resort to external tools.

## üöÄ What are the next steps in this project?

The objective will be to introduce more countries in order to validate the tax numbers of all of them.
